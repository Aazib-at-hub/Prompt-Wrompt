Prompt-Wrompt 🧠

A prompt library for daily professional and productivity tasks

📌 About
Prompt-Wrompt is a curated collection of AI prompts designed for real-world, everyday tasks — not image or video generation.
While most prompt libraries focus on creative generation, this project focuses on how people actually use AI daily:
Writing better content
Thinking clearly
Planning effectively
Solving problems
Learning faster
Improving professional workflows

👉 Good prompt = Good result

No matter how powerful an AI model is, the quality of its output depends on the quality of the prompt.
