Prompt-Wrompt 🧠

A prompt library for daily professional and productivity tasks

📌 About
Prompt-Wrompt is a curated collection of AI prompts designed for real-world, everyday tasks — not image or video generation.
While most prompt libraries focus on creative generation, this project focuses on how people actually use AI daily:
Writing better content
Thinking clearly
Planning effectively
Solving problems
Learning faster
Improving professional workflows

👉 Good prompt = Good result

No matter how powerful an AI model is, the quality of its output depends on the quality of the prompt.

This is built for students, developers, professionals, creators, and anyone using AI beyond images and videos.
